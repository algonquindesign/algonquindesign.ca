	The <a href="{{ site.data.fswep.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Student Work Experience Program (FSWEP)</a> is the main entry point for students who want paid work experience with the Government of Canada, including in design, communications, and related roles. Students create a single online application that managers across federal departments can search when hiring.
</p>
<h4>
	What is FSWEP?
</h4>
<p>
	FSWEP is the largest student employment program in the federal public service, offering opportunities for students in all fields of study to work in departments and agencies across Canada. Positions range from communications, graphic and web support, and UX, to policy, research, and administration, so design students can gain experience on real government projects and teams.
</p>
<p>
	FSWEP jobs are paid, can be full-time in the summer or other non-academic terms, and part-time during the school year. Many managers use FSWEP to identify future term or entry-level hires, so strong performance can open doors to longer-term public service careers.
</p>
<h4>
	Why it matters to you
</h4>
<p>
	Working through FSWEP lets you see how design functions inside a large, complex organization that serves millions of Canadians. You can build a portfolio of work that includes real federal projects, from digital communications to internal campaigns and service design.
</p>
<p>
	FSWEP experience also helps you understand accessibility standards, bilingual and multicultural communication, and government brand systems, all of which are highly valued skills in the public sector and beyond. It aligns well with the fieldwork goals of this course: mentored professional practice on real client work in a structured environment.
</p>
<h4>
	Who is eligible?
</h4>
<p>
	To apply, you must meet all FSWEP eligibility criteria:
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>Be registered as a full-time student at an accredited secondary or post-secondary institution, as defined by your school.</li>
	<li>Be returning to full-time studies in the next academic term.</li>
	<li>Meet the minimum legal working age in the province or territory where the job is located.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Students with disabilities who are recognized by their institution as having full-time status are eligible, including those in adult or retraining programs. International students with valid work authorization may be considered when no eligible, qualified Canadian students are available, but priority goes to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
</p>
<h4>
	How FSWEP hiring works
</h4>
<p>
	When you apply, your profile goes into a national inventory that federal organizations can search when they have student openings. Managers request referrals that match their needs (for example: study level, field such as “communications” or “design,” location, skills, official languages).
</p>
<p>
	From the inventory, the Public Service Commission randomly selects at least five eligible students that fit the criteria and emails them to confirm interest and availability. Those who confirm are referred to the hiring manager, who reviews applications, may hold interviews or tests, and then makes a job offer to the selected student(s).
</p>
<h4>
	How to apply: step-by-step
</h4>
<p>
	You apply online through the Government of Canada’s student jobs portal (GC Jobs) by completing an FSWEP application and uploading your résumé. The FSWEP application is ongoing, so you should apply early in the academic year and update your file as your skills and experience grow.

<h3>
	Tips for design students applying
</h3>
<p>
	To make your application more compelling for design-related roles:
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>Use “areas of work” that reflect design, communications, web, or digital media so managers searching those fields can find you.</li>
	<li>Emphasize experience with branding, layout, accessibility, and bilingual or multicultural communication where applicable, as these align with many federal design needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You should also maintain a polished online portfolio and be ready to share it if a hiring manager requests work samples. Treat each contact from a department as an interview opportunity: respond promptly, be professional, and show how your design skills can help them communicate clearly with Canadians.
