### Assessment

DSN1690 Fieldwork & Professional Practice is a pass/fail course. It must be successfully completed to graduate from the Graphic Design program.

The fieldwork placement runs from {{ site.data.course-info.fieldwork-start-date}} to {{ site.data.course-info.fieldwork-end-date }}. You need to complete a minimum of 180 hours during the 6 week period. Students are expected to work the same hours as other employees.

As an acting employee, you will have access to personal or confidential information about the firms and clients they are working with. You must recognize the importance of maintaining confidentiality. Failure to do so constitutes a serious breach of ethics which may result in expulsion from the placement. This would incur an 'incomplete' grade, which would mean you would need to repeat this course the next year.

To pass the course, you must participate in either or all of the following:

- Fundraising events
- Grad Show organization
- Activities related to your team
- Completion of fieldwork
- Completion of a fieldwork journal

### Already Doing Design Work?

If you already have work in the field of design you should be all set for Fieldwork. The only condition is that it continues during the six-week time window.

### Portfolio Development

It's up to you to develop your portfolio to apply for Fieldwork, though you will get support in your courses between now and the time to apply. These are a few tips:

- Focus your portfolio pieces on the type of work you're looking for.
- A printed portfolio is only necessary for those looking for work in print.
- A résumé is important, but secondary to the portfolio.
- You can modify school work to suit your portfolio.

It's a good idea to show your portfolio to professional designers as you work on it. There some [guidance on that here](/portfolio-development/).

### Fieldwork Journal

You must complete a journal describing your activities and duties during fieldwork.

These journals should not contain sensitive materials but an overall log of type of work done at your place of work.

Your progress is reviewed by your supervisor to give feedback on academic performance, attendance and attitude. The program coordinator(s) may visit each workplace site during the six weeks to discuss the student’s progress with the employer, or discuss progress through a telephone conversation.

If you wish to be on the confirmed graduation list, journals and reports must be submitted no later than two days before the conclusion of the placement.

A document will be sent to you at a later date.
