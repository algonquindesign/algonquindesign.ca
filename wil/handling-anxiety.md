	<ol>
		<li>Preparation Before the Review</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Script Key Points</li>
			<p>
				Write down short talking points for each project in your portfolio. They can include what the project was, the problem you solved, and what you learned.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Benefit:</strong> Having prompts ready helps prevent blanking in the moment.
			</p>
			<li>Practice with a Friendly Audience</li>
			<p>
				Rehearse presenting your portfolio with a classmate, mentor, or even in front of a mirror.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Benefit:</strong> Familiarity reduces anxiety, making the conversation feel more natural.
			</p>
			<li>Prepare a Few Go-To Questions</li>
			<p>
				Having questions ready can take the pressure off when conversation slows. Examples include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“What stands out to you about this project?”</li>
				<li>“Do you see ways I could make this piece stronger?”</li>
				<li>“What do you look for in a junior designer?”</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Accept Nervousness as Normal</li>
			<p>
				Even professionals get anxious. Acknowledging nerves with “I’m a little nervous but excited to be here” can help ease them.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<li>During the Review</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Start with a Smile and Simple Greeting</li>
			<p>
				A short introduction like, “Hi, I’m Johnny. Thanks for looking at my work!” works perfectly.
			</p>
			<li>Focus on Listening</li>
			<p>
				Reviewers are there to give feedback and help. The goal is to absorb insights, not to deliver a perfect pitch.
			</p>
			<li>Take Notes</li>
			<p>
				Jotting down feedback shows professionalism, helps you remember key points, and gives your hands something to do.
			</p>
			<li>Pause and Breathe</li>
			<p>
				Taking a breath before responding can calm nerves and make answers sound more thoughtful.
			</p>
			<li>Keep Responses Simple</li>
			<p>
				You don’t need to fill every silence. Short, genuine responses such as “That’s a great point. I’ll think about that” work well.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<li>After the Review</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Reflect on the Feedback</li>
			<p>
				Write down the most valuable points right away before they’re forgotten.
			</p>
			<li>Follow Up</li>
			<p>
				A short thank-you email or LinkedIn message can leave a positive impression.
			</p>
			<li>Celebrate the Effort</li>
			<p>
				Participating is an accomplishment. Simply showing up and sharing your work is a win.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<li>Mindset Shifts</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Reframe the Event</li>
			<p>
				Think of it as an opportunity to gather insight, not a test to pass or fail.
			</p>
			<li>Set Micro-Goals</li>
			<p>
				Break the experience into small, achievable steps, like introducing yourself to two reviewers or asking one question per table.
			</p>
			<li>See It as Practice</li>
			<p>
				Every review or networking event is a chance to get more comfortable and build confidence for the future.
			</p>
		</ul>
