title: Handling Anxiety
---
Meeting new people and sharing your work can feel intimidating, but there are practical strategies to make the experience easier and more rewarding.

>   The best response to anxiety is action.

### **1. Preparation Before the Review**

* **Script Key Points**
    Write down short talking points for each project in your portfolio. They can include what the project was, the problem you solved, and what you learned.
    **Benefit:** Having prompts ready helps prevent blanking in the moment.

* **Practice with a Friendly Audience**
    Rehearse presenting your portfolio with a classmate, mentor, or even in front of a mirror.
    **Benefit:** Familiarity reduces anxiety, making the conversation feel more natural.

* **Prepare a Few Go-To Questions**
    Having questions ready can take the pressure off when conversation slows. Examples include:
    * “What stands out to you about this project?”
    * “Do you see ways I could make this piece stronger?”
    * “What do you look for in a junior designer?”

* **Accept Nervousness as Normal**
    Even professionals get anxious. Acknowledging nerves with “I’m a little nervous but excited to be here” can help ease them.

### **2. During the Review**

* **Start with a Smile and Simple Greeting**
    A short introduction like, “Hi, I’m Johnny. Thanks for looking at my work!” works perfectly.

* **Focus on Listening**
    Reviewers are there to give feedback and help. The goal is to absorb insights, not to deliver a perfect pitch.

* **Take Notes**
    Jotting down feedback shows professionalism, helps you remember key points, and gives your hands something to do.

* **Pause and Breathe**
    Taking a breath before responding can calm nerves and make answers sound more thoughtful.

* **Keep Responses Simple**
    You don’t need to fill every silence. Short, genuine responses such as “That’s a great point. I’ll think about that” work well.


### **3. After the Review**

* **Reflect on the Feedback**
    Write down the most valuable points right away before they’re forgotten.

* **Follow Up**
    A short thank-you email or LinkedIn message can leave a positive impression.

* **Celebrate the Effort**
    Participating is an accomplishment. Simply showing up and sharing your work is a win.


### **4. Mindset Shifts**

* **Reframe the Event**
    Think of it as an opportunity to gather insight, not a test to pass or fail.

* **Set Micro-Goals**
    Break the experience into small, achievable steps, like introducing yourself to two reviewers or asking one question per table.

* **See It as Practice**
    Every review or networking event is a chance to get more comfortable and build confidence for the future.
