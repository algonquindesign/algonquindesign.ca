Your portfolio is a living document. This means that you develop it gradually and continually. Eventually, you'll have a repository of dozens of pieces from which you can choose for specific presentations.

### Showing Work for the First Time

It's natural that you may feel intimidated showing your work for the first time. That's why it's a good idea to do it as soon as possible. See [this page for more on this](/portfolio-feedback/). This means you should start some time in second year. By then you have pieces that reflect your skills, talent, and your potential.

Don't put off showing your work out of nervousness. Dive in. After the first time, you'll come to find that it's easy, constructive, and even enjoyable.

Listen to everyone. Take notes. Make revisions. Show reviewers your progress. Devise your own path that best reflects you as a designer.

While presenting, be sure to avoid words that diminish your work. Some examples to avoid:

- In this piece, I *just created a simple layout*...
- I *played with the design* quite a bit.

It's actually quite the opposite. You should use language such as:

- *I'm really proud of* the type treatment in this piece because...
- *This piece is particularly strong* due to its unique use of colour.

### Use Its Native Format

Show each piece in its native form. If you have a motion piece, have it rendered to play locally and upload to YouTube or to Vimeo so they can see it when they wish. If you have a print piece, photograph it and print it. Assemble to exacting standards, as if it came off the press. You get the idea. Show web designs in the browser, locally and online.

Never rely on the internet access. Have each piece on your computer and online.

### Keep It Updated

As stated at the top of this page, your portfolio is a living document. When you complete your next killer project, be sure to include it in your portfolio. Eventually, you'll have enough pieces that you'll be able to include certain ones to tailor your portfolio to a specific employer.

### How Many Pieces?

How many pieces to include in your portfolio is a common question to which there's no single answer. One important criteria is that each piece is a source of great pride for you. You should want to brag about each one to everyone you know. You can present as few as five. A maximum number is about a dozen. More than that gets a bit long to present at once.

That said, with time, you may have dozens of pieces in a portfolio repository from which you can choose for any single presentation. This takes time to build. It should be a long-term goal.

### Various Tips

- Some suggest to place your strongest pieces at the start and at the end of your portfolio presentation. Frankly, all your pieces should be the strongest. If there are some that aren't quite that great, you should not include them in your portfolio until they are worthy.
- If there are pieces in your portfolio that came from a collaborative project, be sure to indicate that in your presentation. Clearly state your part in the project.
- It's crucial that your whole portfolio is error-free. This includes errors in the design, as well as grammar and spelling. It's best to have it proofed by multiple people.
- Practice your presentation before any formal reviews. This will help you better estimate how much time it will take and what you will say. Practicing will also allow you to speak more naturally, without reading any notes.
- Be sure to point out elements of your designs that you are particularly proud of.
