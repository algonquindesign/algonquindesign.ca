The goal of these activities is for students to secure a position for their six-week internship where they will be mentored by professional designers working on real-world client projects."

You will be organized in teams, each with a task described here. Each week, teams meet to move their responsibilites forward. Attendance & participation by each student is a requirement for passing the course."
