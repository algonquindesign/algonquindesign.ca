I know what some of you might be thinking:
<p class="italic semibold dark-green">
“My portfolio isn’t perfect yet.”
</p>
<p class="italic semibold dark-green">
“What if reviewers think I’m not ready?”
</p>
<p class="italic semibold dark-green">
“Maybe I’ll just sit this one out.”
</p>

Here’s the thing, this review isn’t about being perfect. It’s about progress. Employers and mentors understand you’re still a student. They want to see your ideas, your thinking, and your growth. You’ll get insights that will help you *polish* your portfolio before interviews, not judgment about where you’re at today.

So bring what you’ve got, show your work, ask questions, and soak in as much feedback as you can. You’ll walk away more confident and better prepared; plus, it’s always great to connect and chat with professionals in the industry.

#### Tips to Prep

The general rule is to show your work in the medium it was made for. If it's a print piece, bring a printed sample if you can. You can also have it in a PDF file. If it's motion, obviously show the rendered piece. Web, in a browser, and so on…

> Bring something to document the feedback, so you don't forget anything.

Feel free to ask the reviewers *anything*. This isn't an actual interview. You can ask what's the best way to proceed. You can ask anything about your case studies. *If you're anxious, you can acknowledge nerves.* This is a safe environment to learn.

We'll start with a panel discussion so reviewers can take your questions. Then, it works like speed dating. You'll get about 15 minutes facetime with a reviewer to show your work, and get feedback & advice. You'll likely get the chance to see many reviewers.

See you on **Saturday, January 31**, from **9 a.m. to noon at the AC Hub**. Don’t talk yourself out of going that morning. Come as you are, portfolio in hand!
