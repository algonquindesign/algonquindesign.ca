	Ontarians who choose college don’t just earn more money over their lifetime. They’re healthier, happier, more likely to get the support they need when facing mental health challenges, plus more connected to their communities. We’re breaking down the real statistics on lifetime earnings, physical health, mental wellness, plus civic engagement to show you why a college education like the graphic design program at Algonquin College could be one of the best investments you make in your future.

<h4>
	Lifelong Income and Financial Security
</h4>
<p>
	Financial stability over a lifetime is one of the most measurable benefits of college education.<sup><a href="#sources">*</a></sup>
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li><strong>Lifetime Earnings Premium:</strong> A Statistics Canada study analyzing earnings over a 20-year period found that men with a college certificate earned approximately <strong>$248,000</strong> more than those with only a high school diploma. Women with a college certificate earned roughly <strong>$180,000</strong> more over the same period.</li>
	<li> <strong>Annual Earnings Gap:</strong> In Ontario, the median income for a college graduate is approximately <strong>$56,550</strong>, compared to <strong>$46,960</strong> for a high school graduate. This represents an annual difference of nearly $10,000. </li>
	<li> <strong>Employment Stability:</strong> During economic downturns, individuals with post-secondary education face lower unemployment rates. College graduates are less likely to experience layoffs compared to those with only a high school diploma. </li>
	<li> <strong>Retirement Security:</strong> College graduates are more likely to have jobs that offer employer-sponsored pension plans. This leads to greater financial security in retirement. </li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Mental Health Outcomes
</h4>
<p>
	Higher education correlates with better access to care and improved mental well-being.<sup><a href="#sources">*</a></sup>
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li><strong>Seeking Support:</strong> Individuals with post-secondary education are <strong>12% to 16%</strong> more likely to seek professional mental health support when needed. This suggests that those with only a high school education may be more likely to suffer in silence without accessing available help.</li>
	<li><strong>Self-Rated Mental Health:</strong> Ontarians with post-secondary credentials consistently report higher levels of self-rated mental health compared to those with high school education or less.</li>
	<li><strong>Intergenerational Benefits:</strong> The benefits extend to the next generation. In Ontario, <strong>76.8%</strong> of parents with a college or trades education reported their children had “Excellent/Very Good” mental health, compared to only <strong>73.2%</strong> of parents with high school education or less.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Physical Health and Longevity
</h4>
<p>
	Education is a key social determinant of health, affecting how long and how well people live.<sup><a href="#sources">*</a></sup>
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li><strong>Self-Rated Health:</strong> College graduates are significantly more likely to rate their physical health as “excellent” or “very good” compared to high school graduates.</li>
	<li><strong>Hospitalization Rates:</strong> Studies indicate that individuals with only a high school diploma have <strong>27% more hospital stays</strong> and <strong>19% more consultations with specialists</strong> than those with higher education.</li>
	<li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Lower education levels are associated with higher rates of chronic conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Civic Engagement
</h4>
<p>
	Graduates often feel more connected to their communities.<sup><a href="#sources">*</a></sup>
</p>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li><strong>Volunteering:</strong> Millennials with post-secondary education are up to <strong>twice as likely</strong> to volunteer compared to those without a high school diploma.</li>
	<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Higher education correlates with increased participation in community organizations. This fosters a stronger sense of belonging and social purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>
College is not a magic fix for every problem, yet the long-term trends are clear: more education usually means more income, better health, plus stronger support when life gets stressful. If you are unsure about your next step after high school, think of college not as <em>more school</em> but as a practical shortcut to skills, connections, and opportunities that most high school graduates never access. Your future self will not remember the debate about whether it was worth it, only the freedom that comes from having more choices.
