<p>
	The goal is to secure your preferred opportunity and still leave every employer with a positive impression of you.
</p>
<h4>
	Get clear on what you really want
</h4>
<p>
	Before you answer anyone, take time to decide what <i>best</i> actually means for you.
</p>
Consider:<br>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li> Type of work and how it will strengthen your portfolio.</li>
	<li> Mentorship and feedback you are likely to receive.</li>
	<li> Studio culture and team fit.</li>
	<li> Schedule, commute, and any pay or stipend.</li>
	<li> Possibility of future work or a longer term role.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Make a simple comparison: one page, with each offer listed and quick notes for pros and cons in each category. This keeps you focused on your goals instead of pressure or guilt.
</p>
<h4>
	Ask for time, do not go silent
</h4>
<p>
	When you receive an offer and you are still waiting to hear back from others, you can absolutely ask for time.
</p>
Example script:<br>
<blockquote>
	“Thank you so much for the offer. I am excited about this opportunity and I really appreciate it. Would it be possible to have until [day and date] to review everything and get back to you?”
</blockquote>
Guidelines:<br>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>Always start with genuine thanks.</li>
	<li>Ask for a specific deadline, not <i>a bit more time</i>.</li>
	<li>If you need one extension, ask once, briefly and politely.</li>
	<li>Do not disappear. Ghosting is unprofessional. The design community is small.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Mention other opportunities ethically
</h4>
<p>
	It is okay to let an employer know that you are considering more than one option, as long as you are respectful and not trying to <i>play</i> them against each other.
</p>
Statements you can use:<br>
<blockquote>
	“I am currently considering a couple of opportunities. I want to make a thoughtful decision.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	“I remain very interested in your placement. I do have another offer with a deadline of [day]. Is there any chance you might have an update on my candidacy before then?”
</blockquote>
Tips:
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>You do not have to name the other studio or employer.</li>
	<li>Avoid sounding like you are using offers as leverage.</li>
	<li>Keep the tone calm, appreciative, and factual.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Accept your favourite offer clearly
</h4>
<p>
	When you have decided which placement you want, move quickly and confirm in writing.
</p>
A simple acceptance email:<br>
<pre>
Subject: Fieldwork Offer Acceptance

Dear [Name],

Thank you again for offering me the [role] position for the upcoming fieldwork term. I am pleased to accept.

To confirm, the placement will run from [start date] to [end date], at [location or remote], and I will be working on [brief description if known].

If you have further questions about Fieldwork, please do not hesitate to ask me, or our Program Coordinator, Alain Paradis at paradia@algonquincollege.com

Sincerely,
[Your name]
</pre>
<p>
	Once you've accepted, you can stop pursuing other opportunities. Do not back out later unless there is a serious, unavoidable situation. Reneging can damage your reputation in a small industry.
</p>
<h4>
	Decline other offers politely and keep doors open
</h4>
<p>
	Once you have accepted your preferred placement, you must let other employers know your decision. The goal is to say “no” in a way that keeps the relationship positive.
</p>
Template for declining an offer:<br>
<pre>
Subject: Fieldwork Offer – Thank You

Dear [Name],

Thank you very much for offering me the [role] opportunity at [studio or organization]. I appreciated the chance to meet you and learn more about your team and your work. After careful consideration, I have decided to accept another placement that is a closer fit with my goals at this stage.

It was a difficult decision. I am genuinely grateful for your time and interest. I hope our paths might cross again in the future. I have a great impression of your team and the work you are doing.

If you would like, I am happy to share your posting with my professor and classmates who are still looking for a placement.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
</pre>
Key behaviours:<br>
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>Reply as soon as you have made your decision.</li>
	<li>Be direct about declining, but keep the tone warm and respectful.</li>
	<li>Avoid long justifications. A brief explanation about <i>fit with my goals</i> is enough.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Mindset: think long term, not just this semester
</h4>
<p>
	Every email and conversation is part of your professional reputation. The design world, especially in Ottawa, is connected. People talk.
</p>
Helpful mindset shifts:
<ul class="hanging-list">
	<li>You are not <i>using</i> anyone. You are making a careful decision about your education and career.</li>
	<li>Saying no politely now can still lead to a freelance project, a future job, or a recommendation later.</li>
	<li>Clear communication shows maturity, professionalism, and respect for the employer’s time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you are unsure about how to phrase a message, draft it first, then have a trusted mentor or professor read it before you send.
</p>
